# Calc_you_Later
Odin Project Calculator Project that involves all HTML,CSS and JS

the calculator calculates everything but it lacks some things like:

> > Users should be able to string together several operations and get the right answer, with each pair of numbers being evaluated at a time. For example, 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = should yield 42 but it doesn't yet. I will work on it later and also modify it to become a scientific calculator
